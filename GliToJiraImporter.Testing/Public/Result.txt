Game Minimum RTP
Determination
Internal Notes
NS3.9.15

A game must have a theoretical/estimated statistical expectation that the minimum player return (RTP) of the game will be greater than or equal to [MINRTP]
Choose an item.


NOTE to Engineer: Refer to the applicable Australian Market’s Checkoff for the values for [MINRTP].
Game Maximum RTP
Determination
Internal Notes
NS3.9.16

A game must have a theoretical/estimated statistical expectation that the maximum player return (RTP) of the game will be less than or equal to [MAXRTP]
Choose an item.


NOTE to Engineer: Refer to the applicable Australian Market’s Checkoff for the values for [MAXRTP].
RTP Tolerance
Determination
Internal Notes
NS3.9.16a
Within a single game variation or configuration, a change to the betting options selected must not cause a change to the resultant theoretical player return (RTP) of more than 0.20%. Where one version of game software contains identifiably different games (such as an ante-bet game), the requirement on RTP tolerance will apply to each game separately. 
Choose an item.

Probability
Determination
Internal Notes
NS3.9.16b
The probability for attaining any winning event must not be less than 1/7,000,000 (at a rate of at least 1 in 7 million plays). 
Choose an item.


The calculation of the probabilities is to: 
a) be multiplied by the maximum number of possible lines, ways or patterns available in one play (using the configuration which provides the lowest number of 'maximum lines' etc. available in one play);
b) combine the probabilities for the same winning pattern when occurring in different elements of a play (e.g. base and feature elements);
c) combine the probabilities for the same winning pattern occurring with and without substitute symbols;
d) exclude ‘multipliers’; and
e) ignore all linked progressive jackpots.
Standard Deviation
Determination
Internal Notes
NS3.9.17
The Nominal Standard Deviation (NSD) of a game must be no greater than 15. While the standard deviation of individual components of a game (e.g. feature games, metamorphic sequences etc.) may exceed 15, the NSD of the whole game must not exceed 15. 
Choose an item.


In determining the NSD for a game, the following conventions must be applied: 
a) Calculate standard deviation of the base game at minimum bet and single line play or equivalent. (Should the underlying game algorithm or randomising mechanism change with a change to play options selected (e.g. different virtual reels are activated upon a change to the number of lines played or certain prize categories are only available by selecting specific play options), the highest standard deviation result must be used);
b) Coinciding prizes are to be treated as separate prizes (e.g. a payline prize of 20 coinciding with a scatter prize of 50 are to be treated as two separate prizes of 20 and 50);
c) Feature game prize contribution must, as a minimum, be calculated using a set of individual feature prizes with corresponding weighted probabilities for each prize. (The calculation method must not use the mean of all feature prizes treated as a single base game prize);
d) For the purposes of c) above, feature game prizes are to be calculated under conditions applicable to the feature when the base game is in the mode referred to in a) above (i.e. using the same bet and line pattern or equivalent);
e) Gamble features (e.g. Double-up) are to be excluded;
f) Progressive prize components, both standalone and linked, are to be excluded;
g) All calculations must be made to a minimum accuracy of four decimal places and the NSD must be reported to a minimum accuracy of two decimal places.
Note : For the certification of games with a NSD of greater than 15, the tester must provide clear evidence, in the form of actual game play data produced independently of the manufacturer, that the game will provide the expected rate of return. Despite such evidence being provided, the approval of games with a NSD of greater than 15 will remain at the discretion of the regulator.
Non-linear Paytables
Determination
Internal Notes
NS3.9.18
The minimum return to player must be met when playing at the lowest end of a non linear paytable (e.g. if a game is continuously played at a minimum bet level for its total game cycle and the theoretical RTP is lower than minimum percentage, then the game is unacceptable). This example also extends to games such as Keno where the continuous playing of any spot combination results in a theoretical RTP lower than the minimum percentage 
Choose an item.

Carded Percentage
Determination
Internal Notes
NS3.9.19
A manufacturer may for venue information purposes provide a “carded percentage” which, for games of skill or games with non-linear paytables, represents the player return expected in operation when historical knowledge of player preference or skill is applied. This percentage may appear on the gaming machine program provided it is clearly marked as “carded percentage” or another term not likely to be confused with the minimum return to player. 
Choose an item.

Bet Limit
Determination
Internal Notes
NS3.9.20
A limit may apply to the maximum wager that can be made from the player’s Credit meter 
Choose an item.


NOTE to Engineer: Refer to the applicable Australian Market’s Checkoff for the values for [MAXWAGER]
Win Limit
Determination
Internal Notes
NS3.9.20a
A limit may apply to the maximum amount that can be won in any game element for non-progressive games and by any progressive prize for progressive games. 
Choose an item.


The maximum non-progressive win may be won in any individual game element.  This is further clarified as being the sum of all prizes (coinciding wins) awarded in a game element (i.e. the total of all prizes resulting from winning patterns, bonuses, multipliers etc. in that individual game element).  
Choose an item.


Example :- A play consists of base game element, 5 free game elements and 2 gamble game elements.  The maximum non-progressive win may be won in each and every game element - 8 in total.

a) display clearly to the player which game rules apply to the current game state;
Choose an item.


b) display to the player sufficient information to indicate the current status towards the triggering of the next metamorphosis of the game (e.g. if the game collects tokens towards a feature, the number of tokens missing or the total number required to trigger the metamorphosis must be indicated along with the number of tokens collected at that point);
Choose an item.


c) not adjust the likelihood of a metamorphosis occurring, based on the history of prizes obtained in previous games (i.e. games must not adapt their theoretical return to player based on past payouts); and
Choose an item.

Game Fairness Objectives
Determination
Internal Notes
NS3.9.57
All games are to be fair to players in that the game must not be designed to give the player a false expectation of better odds by falsely representing any occurrence or event. For example, games (and features within games) that incorporate an illusion of control in that players are offered an option which appears to provide an opportunity to influence the outcome of a game using skill, when in fact the outcome cannot be influenced by the use of skill and/or the outcome has already been determined, are not acceptable.
Choose an item.

NS3.9.57a
The display of the result of a game outcome must not be misleading or deceptive to the player (e.g. must not improperly indicate a near-miss).
Choose an item.

For games that simulate or involve spinning reels, spinning wheels (such as roulette), rolling of dice, tossing of coins, or other similar activities the following will apply: 

a) for each spinning reel, the probability of any one position appearing must be as for the actual physical device (e.g. 1/20 for a 20 position reel), unless the game rules clearly indicate otherwise (refer Artwork requirements),
Choose an item.


b) for each spinning wheel, die, or coin etc., the probability of any one face appearing must be as for the actual physical device (e.g. 1/10 for a 10 segment wheel; 1/6 for a 6 faced die; ½ for a coin),

NOTE TO ENGINEER: This requirement applies to all types of wheel, die, coin or real world objects presented to the player. The probability and visual representation of each face/segment that is displayed must be equivalent to that of the real world object (eg. All positions of a 10 segment wheel occur 1/10 where each segment is visually of equal size, where the segments are of unequal size the probability of each segment must equate to the segments relative portion of the whole wheel, all sides of a die occur 1/6 for a 6 faced die). It is not acceptable to circumvent this requirement via artwork rules.

a) each position of the virtual reel must have the same probability of occurring (i.e. if the virtual reel consists of n positions, the probability of occurrence of each position must be 1/n).
Choose an item.


b) symbols of the physical reel must appear to the player in the same arrangement as for the virtual reel (i.e. it must not be possible to determine by observing the symbols displayed on the machine that the physical reels are used instead of virtual reels). This observation extends to all symbols visible to the player.

Minimum Period for Prize Determination using One RNG Value
Determination
Internal Notes
NS3.14.11
Following a low probability game outcome (e.g. a jackpot win, major prize win, or a particular graphic game result presentation), where that game outcome is represented by only one RNG value or a small number of RNG values, it is important that subsequent game play on that machine is unpredictable. The intent here is to ensure that the machine does not subsequently go through one defined sequence of game outcomes, or one of only a few possible sequences of game outcomes, and that game outcomes are consistent with the mathematical model of the game. Thus in such implementations, the ‘Period’ of the RNG must be a factor greater than its ‘Range’.
Choose an item.

Minimum Range Requirement

a) the output resulting from the mapping of an RNG to symbols (or reel stop positions) must not be predictable;
Choose an item.


b) any outcome derived from the random number generator are uniformly distributed;
Choose an item.


c) any mappings to convert random numbers into game symbols are linear, and the distribution of the mapped symbols is identical to the distribution of the unmapped random number from which they were derived;
Choose an item.


d) the mapped random number sequence must demonstrate that they are statistically random when subject to the same statistical tests for randomness specified for the base random number generator; and
Choose an item.


e) the game outcomes which are derived from either a combination of mapped symbols or directly from the unmapped random numbers must have the same distribution and probability of occurrence as the game that the machine implements. In particular, poker games must have the same first hand distribution and probability as hands dealt from a randomly shuffled deck of cards; spinning reel games must have the same outcome probabilities and outcome distribution as the physical model upon which the game is based, and so on.
Choose an item.

Scaling Algorithms
Determination
Internal Notes
NS3.14.14
If a random number with a range shorter than that provided by the RNG is required for some purpose within the gaming machine, the method of re-scaling, (i.e. converting the number to the lower range), is to be designed such that all numbers within the lower range are equally probable.
Choose an item.

NS3.14.15

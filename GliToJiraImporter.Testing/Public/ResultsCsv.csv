NOTE to Engineer: Refer to the applicable Australian Market’s Checkoff for the values for [MAXRTP]."
"Game Play","RTP Tolerance","NS3.9.16a","Within a single game variation or configuration, a change to the betting options selected must not cause a change to the resultant theoretical player return (RTP) of more than 0.20%. Where one version of game software contains identifiably different games (such as an ante-bet game), the requirement on RTP tolerance will apply to each game separately. "
"Game Play","Probability","NS3.9.16b","The probability for attaining any winning event must not be less than 1/7,000,000 (at a rate of at least 1 in 7 million plays). 
The calculation of the probabilities is to: 
a) be multiplied by the maximum number of possible lines, ways or patterns available in one play (using the configuration which provides the lowest number of 'maximum lines' etc. available in one play);
b) combine the probabilities for the same winning pattern when occurring in different elements of a play (e.g. base and feature elements);
c) combine the probabilities for the same winning pattern occurring with and without substitute symbols;
d) exclude ‘multipliers’; and
e) ignore all linked progressive jackpots."
"Game Play","Standard Deviation","NS3.9.17","The Nominal Standard Deviation (NSD) of a game must be no greater than 15. While the standard deviation of individual components of a game (e.g. feature games, metamorphic sequences etc.) may exceed 15, the NSD of the whole game must not exceed 15. 
In determining the NSD for a game, the following conventions must be applied: 
a) Calculate standard deviation of the base game at minimum bet and single line play or equivalent. (Should the underlying game algorithm or randomising mechanism change with a change to play options selected (e.g. different virtual reels are activated upon a change to the number of lines played or certain prize categories are only available by selecting specific play options), the highest standard deviation result must be used);
b) Coinciding prizes are to be treated as separate prizes (e.g. a payline prize of 20 coinciding with a scatter prize of 50 are to be treated as two separate prizes of 20 and 50);
c) Feature game prize contribution must, as a minimum, be calculated using a set of individual feature prizes with corresponding weighted probabilities for each prize. (The calculation method must not use the mean of all feature prizes treated as a single base game prize);
d) For the purposes of c) above, feature game prizes are to be calculated under conditions applicable to the feature when the base game is in the mode referred to in a) above (i.e. using the same bet and line pattern or equivalent);
e) Gamble features (e.g. Double-up) are to be excluded;
f) Progressive prize components, both standalone and linked, are to be excluded;
g) All calculations must be made to a minimum accuracy of four decimal places and the NSD must be reported to a minimum accuracy of two decimal places.
Note : For the certification of games with a NSD of greater than 15, the tester must provide clear evidence, in the form of actual game play data produced independently of the manufacturer, that the game will provide the expected rate of return. Despite such evidence being provided, the approval of games with a NSD of greater than 15 will remain at the discretion of the regulator."
"Game Play","Non-linear Paytables","NS3.9.18","The minimum return to player must be met when playing at the lowest end of a non linear paytable (e.g. if a game is continuously played at a minimum bet level for its total game cycle and the theoretical RTP is lower than minimum percentage, then the game is unacceptable). This example also extends to games such as Keno where the continuous playing of any spot combination results in a theoretical RTP lower than the minimum percentage "
"Game Play","Carded Percentage","NS3.9.19","A manufacturer may for venue information purposes provide a “carded percentage” which, for games of skill or games with non-linear paytables, represents the player return expected in operation when historical knowledge of player preference or skill is applied. This percentage may appear on the gaming machine program provided it is clearly marked as “carded percentage” or another term not likely to be confused with the minimum return to player. "
"Game Play","Bet Limit","NS3.9.20","A limit may apply to the maximum wager that can be made from the player’s Credit meter 
NOTE to Engineer: Refer to the applicable Australian Market’s Checkoff for the values for [MAXWAGER]"
"Game Play","Win Limit","NS3.9.20a","A limit may apply to the maximum amount that can be won in any game element for non-progressive games and by any progressive prize for progressive games. 
The maximum non-progressive win may be won in any individual game element.  This is further clarified as being the sum of all prizes (coinciding wins) awarded in a game element (i.e. the total of all prizes resulting from winning patterns, bonuses, multipliers etc. in that individual game element).  
Example :- A play consists of base game element, 5 free game elements and 2 gamble game elements.  The maximum non-progressive win may be won in each and every game element - 8 in total.
NOTE to Engineer: Refer to the applicable Australian Market’s Checkoff for the values for [MAXNPWIN] and [MAXPWIN]."

"Game Play","Gamble","NS3.9.27 ","Gamble bets may incorporate a variety of symbols, player choices, or win chances. "
"Game Play","Gamble","NS3.9.28","Partial transfer of winnings to the Gamble feature is acceptable (e.g. half stake Double-up) however amounts not wagered on a Gamble element must be transferred to the player’s Credit meter:-
a) at the time the player selects partial Gamble,
b) immediately after the completion of the Gamble element, or
c) immediately after the completion of the play.
Note: Amounts not wagered on a Gamble element and not transferred to the player’s Credit meter as at a) or b) must be stored in critical memory.  "
"Game Play","Gamble","NS3.9.28a","Where the division of winnings for partial transfer to the Gamble feature results in a remainder, the remainder must be included in the amount transferred to the Credit meter. 
Example: Win on base element = 101 credits; Transfer to half stake Gamble = 50 credits; Transfer to Credit meter = 51 credits"
"Game Play","Gamble","NS3.9.29","Gamble may offer other multipliers other than two (2) e.g. “pick a suit” where four outcomes may be offered provided that the other requirements of this section are met (e.g. a 100% RTP). "

"Game Play","Gamble","NS3.9.31","At all times during a Gamble feature, the amount to be wagered or available to the Gamble feature must be simultaneously displayed in both dollars and cents and credits. A display which alternates between dollars and cents and credits will be acceptable provided that both values are easily distinguished. "
"Game Play","Auto Gamble","NS3.9.32","If Auto Gamble is provided, automatic entry to a Gamble feature should only be activated upon a win from a primary game or completion of a feature game(s). It must be possible for the player to disable the Auto Gamble feature at any time. If Auto Gamble is used, the player should be given the option to exit the Gamble feature without playing. "
"Game Play","Requirements of Metamorphic Games","NS3.9.33","Games that are not completely independent of player’s history (i.e. metamorphic) must: 
a) display clearly to the player which game rules apply to the current game state;
b) display to the player sufficient information to indicate the current status towards the triggering of the next metamorphosis of the game (e.g. if the game collects tokens towards a feature, the number of tokens missing or the total number required to trigger the metamorphosis must be indicated along with the number of tokens collected at that point);
c) not adjust the likelihood of a metamorphosis occurring, based on the history of prizes obtained in previous games (i.e. games must not adapt their theoretical return to player based on past payouts); and
d) not be misleading. If a game's metamorphosis is triggered after accruing a certain number of tokens or combination of tokens of different kind, the probability of obtaining like tokens must not deteriorate as the game progresses (e.g. for identical tokens it is not permitted that the last few tokens needed are more difficult to obtain than the previous tokens of that kind)."
"Game Play","Extra Credits Wagered During Metamorphic Games","NS3.9.34","If a feature of metamorphic games requires extra credits to be wagered and the game accumulates all winnings (from the trigger and the feature) to a temporary “win” meter (rather than directly to the credit meter), the game must: 
a) provide a means where winnings on the temporary meter can be bet (via the credit meter) to allow for instances where the player has an insufficient credit meter balance to complete the feature; and
b) transfer all credits on the temporary meter to the credit meter upon completion of the feature."
"Game Play","Metamorphic Game’s Return","NS3.9.35","The game's player return over the cycle of both the metamorphic and non-metamorphic part of the game must conform to the minimum theoretical return to player. "
"Game Play","Metamorphic Game’s Return","NS3.9.36","If features of a metamorphic game require extra credits to be wagered, the game's theoretical return to player during the feature must be greater than the return of the base game."
"Game Play","Metamorphic Game’s Return","NS3.9.37","If the player is allowed to wager at less than the available optimum strategy during a metamorphic game feature, the manufacturer must provide evidence that this option will not reduce the overall player return for that game below the minimum theoretical return to player. "
"Game Play","Metamorphic Game’s Return","NS3.9.38","Any accumulated metamorphic game tokens are not to be lost during a full re-configuration if the game that includes the tokens is still available after the full reconfiguration."
"Game Play","Metamorphic Game’s Return","NS3.9.39","The progressive component of a metamorphic game must be set to the mean progressive amount subsequent to a RAM reset. Note that this requirement applies to tokens (or points) that have accumulation towards a feature (or prize), but not a stand-alone progressive jackpot "
"Game Play","Residual Credit Removal","NS3.9.40","If less than or equal to the Maximum Hopper Payout exist on the credit meter and the COLLECT button is pressed, credits must be converted to either the appropriate number of coins and dispensed from the hopper, or if applicable an amount payable via a printed ticket or account transfer. If residual credits exist the manufacturer may provide a residual credit removal play or allow a cancel credit or ticket print to remove the residual credits or return the gaming machine to normal game play (i.e. leave the residual credits on the player’s credit meter for betting).

"Game Play","Residual Credit Removal","NS3.9.56","The Last Game Recall must either display the residual credit removal play result or contain sufficient information (e.g. updated meters) to derive the result."
"Game Play","Game Fairness Objectives","NS3.9.57","All games are to be fair to players in that the game must not be designed to give the player a false expectation of better odds by falsely representing any occurrence or event. For example, games (and features within games) that incorporate an illusion of control in that players are offered an option which appears to provide an opportunity to influence the outcome of a game using skill, when in fact the outcome cannot be influenced by the use of skill and/or the outcome has already been determined, are not acceptable."
"Game Play","Game Fairness Objectives","NS3.9.57a","The display of the result of a game outcome must not be misleading or deceptive to the player (e.g. must not improperly indicate a near-miss)."
"Game Play","Game Fairness Objectives","NS3.9.58","The mapping of numbers directly from the RNG output or through a scaling algorithm shall not influence a symbol to occur with a probability not equal to its statistical expectation."
"Game Play","Game Fairness Objectives","NS3.9.59","Symbols of virtual reel games (video) must be displayed in the same arrangement as per the reel strips. No manipulation and rearrangement of the reel’s symbols when displayed to the player is permitted. "
"Game Play","Game Fairness Objectives","NS3.9.59a","Games from a manufacturer must not have the same name as another game from the same manufacturer if the rules of the game are different. 
Note: The rules of a game are not different where the only distinction concerns a progressive jackpot component."
"Game Play","Card Games","NS3.9.60","The consequences for games depicting cards being drawn from a pack are the following: 
a) card selection must be from a deck of cards that correctly reflects the status of previously drawn cards;
b) cards once removed from the pack must not be returned to the pack except as provided by the rules of the game depicted;
c) the pack must not be reshuffled except as provided by the rules of the game depicted; and
d) as cards are removed from the pack they must be immediately used as directed by the Rules of the game (i.e. are not to be discarded due to adaptive behaviour by the gaming machine)."
"Game Play","Ball Drawing Games","NS3.9.61","The consequences for games depicting balls being drawn from a barrel (e.g. Keno) are as follows: 
a) at the start of each play only balls applicable to the game are to be depicted;
b) balls once removed from the barrel must not be returned to the barrel except as provided by the rules of the game depicted;
c) the barrel must not be re-mixed except as provided by the rules of the game depicted; and
d) as balls are drawn from the barrel they must be immediately used as directed by the Rules of the game (i.e. are not to be discarded due to adaptive behaviour by the gaming machine)."
"Game Play","Reels, Wheels, Dice, Coins or other real world object","NS3.9.62","For games that simulate or involve spinning reels, spinning wheels (such as roulette), rolling of dice, tossing of coins, or other similar activities the following will apply: 
a) for each spinning reel, the probability of any one position appearing must be as for the actual physical device (e.g. 1/20 for a 20 position reel), unless the game rules clearly indicate otherwise (refer Artwork requirements),
b) for each spinning wheel, die, or coin etc., the probability of any one face appearing must be as for the actual physical device (e.g. 1/10 for a 10 segment wheel; 1/6 for a 6 faced die; ½ for a coin),
NOTE TO ENGINEER: This requirement applies to all types of wheel, die, coin or real world objects presented to the player. The probability and visual representation of each face/segment that is displayed must be equivalent to that of the real world object (eg. All positions of a 10 segment wheel occur 1/10 where each segment is visually of equal size, where the segments are of unequal size the probability of each segment must equate to the segments relative portion of the whole wheel, all sides of a die occur 1/6 for a 6 faced die). It is not acceptable to circumvent this requirement via artwork rules.
Note to Engineer:
The probability and visual display of each segment must be verified against the probabilities documented in the math results
c) the behaviour of each reel, wheel, die, or coin etc. must be independent of all others, and
d) the behaviour of each reel, wheel, die, or coin etc. must be independent of its previous behaviour."
"Game Play","Reels, Wheels, Dice, Coins or other real world object","NS3.9.62a","This clause applies only to games involving physical reels and reel strips, and where the symbols of a virtual reel are mapped to and presented by a physical reel. 
a) each position of the virtual reel must have the same probability of occurring (i.e. if the virtual reel consists of n positions, the probability of occurrence of each position must be 1/n).
b) symbols of the physical reel must appear to the player in the same arrangement as for the virtual reel (i.e. it must not be possible to determine by observing the symbols displayed on the machine that the physical reels are used instead of virtual reels). This observation extends to all symbols visible to the player.
c) accordingly, mapped symbols must have identical sequences of preceding and following symbols (if these symbols are visible to the player) on both the physical and virtual reels."

"Random Number Generator and Symbol Selection","Minimum Period for Prize Determination using One RNG Value","NS3.14.11","Following a low probability game outcome (e.g. a jackpot win, major prize win, or a particular graphic game result presentation), where that game outcome is represented by only one RNG value or a small number of RNG values, it is important that subsequent game play on that machine is unpredictable. The intent here is to ensure that the machine does not subsequently go through one defined sequence of game outcomes, or one of only a few possible sequences of game outcomes, and that game outcomes are consistent with the mathematical model of the game. Thus in such implementations, the ‘Period’ of the RNG must be a factor greater than its ‘Range’."
"Random Number Generator and Symbol Selection","Minimum Range Requirement","NS3.14.12","The range of values produced by the RNG must be adequate to provide sufficient precision and flexibility when setting event outcome probabilities, (i.e. so as to accurately achieve a desired expected return to player)."
"Random Number Generator and Symbol Selection","Mapping","NS3.14.13","Mapping of random numbers into symbols (or reel stop positions) should observe the following principles: 
a) the output resulting from the mapping of an RNG to symbols (or reel stop positions) must not be predictable;
b) any outcome derived from the random number generator are uniformly distributed;
c) any mappings to convert random numbers into game symbols are linear, and the distribution of the mapped symbols is identical to the distribution of the unmapped random number from which they were derived;
d) the mapped random number sequence must demonstrate that they are statistically random when subject to the same statistical tests for randomness specified for the base random number generator; and
e) the game outcomes which are derived from either a combination of mapped symbols or directly from the unmapped random numbers must have the same distribution and probability of occurrence as the game that the machine implements. In particular, poker games must have the same first hand distribution and probability as hands dealt from a randomly shuffled deck of cards; spinning reel games must have the same outcome probabilities and outcome distribution as the physical model upon which the game is based, and so on."
"Random Number Generator and Symbol Selection","Scaling Algorithms","NS3.14.14","If a random number with a range shorter than that provided by the RNG is required for some purpose within the gaming machine, the method of re-scaling, (i.e. converting the number to the lower range), is to be designed such that all numbers within the lower range are equally probable."
"Random Number Generator and Symbol Selection","Scaling Algorithms","NS3.14.15","If a particular random number selected is outside the range of equal distribution of re-scaling values, it is permissible to discard that random number and select the next in sequence for the purpose of re-scaling."

• Coin Yo-Yo - Inserted coin detected moving in the incorrect direction. A single Coin Yo-Yo may be treated as an information only event. Consecutive Coin Yo-Yos are to lead to a gaming machine fault condition. (Cleared by an attendant intervention, e.g. key activation)
• Coin-in Jam - Coin detected not moving - e.g. sensors are continually blocked (Cleared by an attendant intervention, e.g. door open/closed)
• Coin to Cashbox or Diverter Fault - Coins (exceeding a manufacturer defined amount or ratio) detected going to the cashbox instead of the hopper, or vice-versa. Count of misdirected coins may be reset on power-up. (Cleared by the fault being rectified.)
• Excessive Meter Increment - A master meter has increased by more than the increment threshold since the end of the previous play. (Cleared by an attendant intervention, e.g. key activation)
• Hopper Empty - Coins not passing a hopper output sensor within a specified time (Cleared by an attendant intervention, e.g. door open/closed)
• Hopper Jam - The hopper output sensor(s) are blocked (Cleared by an attendant intervention, e.g. door open/closed)
• Extra Coin Paid - Single coin passed hopper sensor after hopper payout completed (Cleared by an attendant intervention, e.g. door open/closed)
• Hopper Run-away - Multiple coins passing hopper sensor (Cleared by an attendant intervention, e.g. door open/closed)
• Hopper Failure - Disconnection or failure of the hopper (not covered by other fault definitions) (Cleared by an attendant intervention, e.g. door open/closed)
• Reel Not Spinning Freely - If applicable, software detecting a reel not spinning correctly (Cleared by an attendant intervention, e.g. door open/closed)
• Illegal Reel Movement - If applicable, software detects unauthorised reel movement (Cleared by an attendant intervention, e.g. door open/closed)
• External Peripheral Controller Fault / Disconnect - Any Peripheral controller fault or communications failure (e.g. a Progressive Display Controller) (Cleared by technician)
• Printer Paper Low - If applicable and possible, the printer paper will soon be exhausted. This should lock up the gaming machine upon completion of a predetermined number of tickets calculated to ensure “Paper Out” is not possible. If a paper out sensor is also provided then “Paper Low” results only in a message. Note that if a gaming machine has a printer it must have a paper low or paper out sensor or both (Paper low condition to be cleared by replacement of paper (paper low signal removed) or positive attendant intervention, e.g. key activation)
• Printer Paper Out - If applicable, the printer paper has been exhausted. The gaming machine must lock-up until the paper out state is cleared (Paper low condition to be cleared by replacement of paper (paper out signal removed) or positive attendant intervention, e.g. key activation)
• Printer Jammed - If applicable, the printer paper is not feeding correctly (Paper jam condition to be cleared by clearance of jam (paper jam signal removed) and positive attendant intervention, e.g. door open/closed)
• Mechanical Meter Disconnected - If applicable, software detects that the mechanical meters have been disconnected (Cleared by technician)
• Low RAM Back-up Battery - If applicable, Back-up RAM Battery has reached a voltage where back-up will become unreliable soon: A message stating that the repairer must be called urgently must be displayed. The gaming machine must lock-up until the battery low event is no longer present and positive indication has been given by an attendant, e.g. jackpot reset key engaged. (Cleared by technician)
• Critical RAM Errors, Mismatch - Some critical RAM error has occurred: When a non-correctable RAM error has occurred, the data on the gaming machine can no longer be considered reliable. Accordingly, any communication to external devices must cease immediately. An appropriate message must be displayed. Access to electronic meters must still be available (Full RAM clear by technician)
• Low Memory - The gaming machine has detected that it is running low on memory and cannot continue operation. Detection of this fault must occur before a total ‘out of memory’ condition corrupts RAM or crashes the gaming machine. This fault may be considered a recoverable RAM error if it occurs for volatile memory, otherwise it must be deemed an irrecoverable RAM error. This fault is applicable only to gaming machines which use dynamically allocated RAM. (Cleared by technician if recovery possible with no loss of Critical Memory, else full RAM clear by Technician must occur.)
• PSD Error - The software has failed its own internal security check. Any communication to external devices must cease immediately. An appropriate message must be displayed, if possible. No modifications to critical meters in RAM must be possible. The gaming machine must lock-up until the fault is rectified. (Full RAM clear or replacement of PSD by technician)"

"Spinning Reel Games","Prizes Layout - Shared Paytables","NS4.3.4","If more than one symbol shares the same paytable, those symbols must be placed in an area that visually belongs to the paytable. This can be achieved with appropriate framing or boxing. The words 'Of a kind' must be placed near the number of symbols required to form a winning pattern and within an area that visually belongs to the paytable for those symbols."
"Spinning Reel Games","Prizes Layout - Mixed or Grouped Symbols","NS4.3.5","If prizes can be awarded for mixed or grouped symbols, the artwork must clearly specify the mixture or grouping of the symbols either by placing the symbols in an area that clearly belongs to the paytable and labelled 'Mixed' or '[X] or [Y] or [Z]… mixed' where [X], [Y] and [Z]… are all the symbols that can participate in a grouped or mixed win. Care must be taken with such phrases as 'Mixed Bars' or 'Mixed Fruit' to ensure that there can be no misinterpretation or ambiguity."
"Spinning Reel Games","Prizes Layout - Prize Tabulation","NS4.3.6","In games that permit multiple credits to be bet, the artwork must include one of the following: 
a) a full tabulation of the prizes for multiple credits bet. The number of credits bet required for each prize must be placed in a location that clearly indicates which prizes apply to which multipliers. Such numbers must have associated with them the wording 'Credits bet per line' or 'Total credits bet' which ever case applies.
b) a tabulation of the prizes for a single credit bet and either the statement 'Line wins multiplied by credits bet per line' or 'Line wins multiplied by total credits bet ', whichever is applicable.
c) a tabulation of the prizes for the minimum bet, if the game does not have a single credit bet available (e.g.. minimum bet is 20 credits). Statements that address how line wins are multiplied must be included on the artwork.
For point b) above, the term “Line wins” may be replaced by “All wins”, “All wins except scatters” or “All wins except scatters [X]” if those are the rules of the game."

"Spinning Reel Games","One Symbol/Prize Instructions","NS4.3.9","Game instructions that belong to only one symbol/prize or a group of symbols/prizes must be clearly associated with the symbol/prize or group of symbols/prizes. This may be achieved with appropriate framing or boxing. Additional wording such as 'these symbols' could also be used."
"Spinning Reel Games","Symbol Appearance","NS4.3.10","A symbols appearance must remain the same throughout all artwork, except while animation is in progress. Any symbol that changes appearance during an animation process must not appear in a way that might misrepresent another symbol in the game."
"Spinning Reel Games","Symbol Reference","NS4.3.11","If game instructions refer to a particular symbol via the name of that symbol, and the name of the symbol may be mistaken for another symbol or may imply other characteristics (e.g. 'Pair of Sunglasses' may be interpreted as two Sunglasses symbols), the visual display of the instructions must clearly indicate to which symbol the instruction is referring. This may be via the display of the actual symbol or a clear description or both."
"Spinning Reel Games","Change of Symbol Function or Appearance","NS4.3.12","If the function of a symbol changes (e.g.. a non-substitute symbol becomes a substitute symbol during a feature), or the symbol’s appearance changes, (e.g.. a red ball changes to a blue ball in a feature) the artwork must clearly describe this change of function or appearance and any special conditions that may apply."
"Spinning Reel Games","Miscellaneous Symbols","NS4.3.13","If a symbol does not appear on all reels, the artwork must clearly state which reels the symbol appears on '[X] appears on reel [reels] only'. Where the term [reels] defines the reel number identifier."
"Spinning Reel Games","Substitute Symbols","NS4.3.14","Substitution can be implemented in various ways depending upon the design of the game and its associated rules. Regardless of the implementation selected, specific substitution rules, in isolation or in combination with other game rules, must clearly explain the operation of a substitute symbol."
"Spinning Reel Games","Substitute Symbols","NS4.3.15","The artwork must state which symbols are substitute symbols. If a symbol is a substitute symbol, the artwork must state for which winning patterns and for which symbols the symbol substitutes, and any conditions that may apply. This must be done in the following manner:
a) If the substitute symbol substitutes for all symbols, the statement '[X] substitutes for all symbols' must be used. 
b) If there is more than one substitute symbol, and each substitutes for all symbols, then the statement '[X] [Y] and [Z] substitute for all symbols' must be used.
c) If the substitute symbol does not substitute for all symbols then either the statement '[X] substitutes for all symbols except [A], [B] and [C]' where [A], [B] and [C] are the exceptions, or the statement '[X] substitutes for [A], [B] and [C]' must be used.
d) If there is more than one substitute symbol, where each substitute symbol has the same exceptions, the statement '[X] [Y] and [Z] substitute for all symbols except [A], [B] and [C]' must be used, where [A], [B] and [C] are the exceptions.
e) If the substitute symbol substitutes for line wins and for only the highest paying scattered symbol appearing, the statement '[X] substitutes for the highest scatter win only and for all other symbols' is required.
f) If the substitute symbol(s) does(do) not behave according to a) through e), then statements that completely identify which symbols are substituted for and which symbols are not substituted for, are required."
"Spinning Reel Games","Prizeless Substitutes","NS4.3.16","Where substitute symbols do not have a pay scale, the prize(s) applicable to an 'all substitute' combination must be clear from the standard game rules, otherwise specific rules regarding prize(s) for an ‘all substitute’ combination must be provided."
"Spinning Reel Games","Vertical Substitutions","NS4.3.17","A 'vertical substitute' substitutes for one or more symbols in all positions on the same reel (i.e. the symbol substitutes vertically). If the game contains such a symbol, the following applies :
a) If the vertical substitute symbol substitutes for all symbols, then the statement '[X] substitutes for all symbols in all positions on that reel' is required.
b) If the vertical substitute symbol substitutes for one or more (but not all) symbols, then the statement '[X] substitutes for [A] [B] and [C] in all positions on that reel' is required.
c) If the vertical substitute symbol substitutes for all symbols except scatters, which are substituted in one position only, the statements '[X] substitutes for all symbols in all positions on that reel except [A] [B] and [C]' and '[A] [B] and [C] are substituted in one position only'.
d) It is acceptable to replace [A] [B] and [C] with the word 'scatters' or a phrase that represents the scatter symbol, provided 4.3.13 is satisfied.
e) If the vertical substitute symbol does not behave according to a), b) or c), then statements that clearly explain the operation of the substitute symbol are required."
"Spinning Reel Games","Substitutes and Extra Pays","NS4.3.18","If extra pays or multipliers are awarded when substitutes participate in winning patterns then a tabulation of all prizes associated with the substitution(s) with all possible multipliers must be displayed or one of a) through d) below :
a) If the game provides for multipliers to apply when one or more occurrences of a substitute participate in a winning pattern, the statement 'If one or more [X] substitute in a win the pay for that win is doubled' must be used, where the word 'doubled' may be replaced with the appropriate game rule (such as 'tripled', 'multiplied by 5' etc.);
NOTE to Engineer: In v10.0-v10.1, the above statement read “substitutes” instead of “substitute”
b) If the game provides for multipliers to apply for each substitute appearing in a winning pattern, the statement 'Every [X] that substitutes in a win doubles the pay for that win' where the words 'doubles the win for that combination' may be replaced with the appropriate game rule (such as 'triples the win for that combination' or 'multiplies the win for that combination by 5' etc.);
c) If the win for the substitute symbol itself is multiplied, the artwork must contain the statements required at a) or b) and an additional statement regarding the treatment of wins for the substitute symbol alone;
d) If the game rules defined at a), b) or c) do not apply, the artwork must contain statements to clearly explain the application of extra pays or multipliers awarded for substitute symbols participating in winning patterns;"

"Spinning Reel Games","Winning Patterns - Order of Reels","NS4.3.20","If either 'All wins left to right and right to left' or 'All wins left to right and right to left except [X] [Y] and [Z]' is stated on the artwork, coinciding wins from both directions are presumed to be added without the need for an additional statement to describe this. If a 5-of-a-kind combination is paid only once, a statement which clarifies this must be included in the artwork."
"Spinning Reel Games","Graphical Representations of Winning Patterns","NS4.3.22","If winning patterns are only represented graphically (without the aid of a written explanation) then they must be supplemented with numbers to indicate how many correct symbols each pattern corresponds to; except for unusual winning patterns (e.g. X_X_x_X_X) where numbers must not be displayed and the pattern must be positioned in proximity to the prize. When unusual winning patterns are implemented then a consistent approach to numbering for usual patterns of the same symbol must be implemented. For example (X_X_x_X_X) is displayed without number then (X_X_x_x_x) of the same symbol can be displayed without number."
"Spinning Reel Games","Difficult Patterns","NS4.3.23","Winning patterns other than common patterns as defined in 4.3.19 must be clearly explained. Graphical representations may be useful."
